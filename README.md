# Wellcome!

I am a Backend and Embedded Developer originationg from Ukraine, currently living, studying and working in Sachsen-Anhalt, Germany. My faschination with Computer Science stems from my love of videogames and fascination with science since childhood. I like to engage in all sorts of developmental activities, which is obvious from my projects tab below, but my main areas are **Backend** (more specifically, Java Spring Boot development) and **Embedded** (mostly, AVR and Arduino projects). I love complex, abstract and highly mathematics-related comp

## Industry Experience

I had experience in commercial projects, that run on ReactJS and Arduino Platforms (yes, you read it right, exactly theese two). For more details, please visit my [LinkedIN Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrii-roshkovan/).

## My Projects:

 - I learned a lot from about programming and electronics doing private Arduino projects, and it was a huge fun. [Check out the Footage](https://youtu.be/MHeMFTgxyAI).
 - Me and my small group of space-loving friends use my Telegram Chat Bot [W1NC3NT](https://github.com/andrews-quest/w1nc3nt), which trecks our debts to each other and shows us a moon-related digest
 - My first big project on Spring were a simulation of a [Real-Life Logistical Application](https://github.com/andrews-quest/full-java-application)
